### Task 3.1 (Most important core UX factors)

Below are the user experience factors our team considers most important for Studyconnect, listed in descending order, with concise reasoning for each.

1) Bequemlichkeit (Convenience)

    Convenience reduces friction and directly affects adoption and retention. Studyconnect should minimise the number of steps and cognitive effort required to complete common tasks (task creation, status updates, quick lookups). Defaults, sensible presets and inline workflows help users accomplish goals quickly and with minimal interruption.

2) Vollständigkeit (Completeness)

    Functional completeness ensures the product addresses core user needs end-to-end. Partial implementations (e.g., chat without task management) risk limiting usage to niche scenarios and undermine the product's value proposition. Prioritise a coherent feature set that supports primary workflows.

3) Aktualität (Timeliness)

    Timely information is essential for collaboration and coordination. Notifications, message delivery and task status changes must be reflected within acceptable latency bounds so users can rely on the system for up-to-date decision making and planning.

4) Effizienz (Efficiency)

    Efficiency is about minimizing elapsed time and effort per interaction. The UI and backend should deliver snappy responses, support bulk or shortcut actions, and avoid blocking flows. Perceived performance (optimistic updates, progressive rendering) significantly improves user satisfaction.

5) Vertrauen (Trust)

    Trust is fundamental for user retention and data-sensitive features. Implement robust authentication, clear privacy practices and appropriate data protection (encryption, secure transport). Communicate security measures transparently to build user confidence.

6) Übersichtlichkeit (Clarity / Overview)

    A clear information architecture and visual hierarchy enable users to locate features and items quickly. Use prioritisation, consistent affordances and unobtrusive visual cues to reduce clutter and make key actions discoverable at a glance.

7) Leichtigkeit (Ease of use)

    Ease of use focuses on reducing micro-friction in common tasks. Small conveniences—autocompletion, sensible defaults, inline editing—reduce task completion time and lower the entry barrier for new users.

8) Verbundenheit (Loyalty)

    Loyalty emerges from sustained value and differentiation. Offer features or experiences that create community and recurring use (shared projects, meaningful notifications, integrations) so that switching costs increase and users remain engaged.

9) Intuitive Bedienung (Intuitive operation)

    Intuitive interactions follow established conventions and reduce learning time. Consistent iconography, predictable navigation and standard affordances (e.g., colour conventions for confirm/cancel) let users operate the product with minimal guidance.

| “That is exactly what I needed.” | Completeness           | This reaction reflects satisfaction with the product’s ability to cover all needed functionalities without gaps, aligning with completeness.     |
| “It makes life easier.”          | Convenience            | Relates directly to reduced user effort and friction, emphasizing the product’s facilitation of everyday tasks.                              |
| “I'm in control.” or “I am the boss.” | Adaptability           | Reflects the user’s sense of authority and ability to customize or manage tasks and workflows effectively.                                   |
| “We know each other.”            | Loyalty                | Denotes community and ongoing engagement that makes users feel connected within the app environment.                                       |
| “Not being alone.”               | Social                 | Highlights the social collaboration capabilities, making users feel supported through interactions in groups.                             |
| “Wow.”                         | Novelty / Originality  | Expresses surprise and delight, often triggered by innovative or unique features enhancing user experience.                               |
| “Something went wrong.”          | Controllability        | Indicates importance of system feedback and error handling, giving users trust in managing unexpected situations.                        |
| “I've never seen anything like this before.” | Novelty              | Highlights uniqueness and first-time use experiences, reinforcing product distinctiveness.                                                  |

### Task 3.3 (Improved UX Factors Analysis with StudyConnect Focus)

| UX Factor             | Why is the factor important?                                        | Designs or features to support this factor                          | What if the factor is ignored?                                               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Convenience           | Making common tasks in StudyConnect fast and effortless encourages regular use and reduces mental overhead needed for planning and updates. | Fast and easy task creation and handling format; allow task creation with minimal info, one-tap status updates, presets for deadlines.  | Slow and tedious operations reduce app usage and deter recommendations.    |
| Efficiency            | Students have limited, fragmented time; efficient workflows maximize productivity during short breaks. | Fast UI responses, optimistic updates, support for task cloning and bulk actions. | Inefficient UI and slow processes frustrate users and reduce engagement.   |
| Clarity / Overview    | Quick navigation and feature discovery increase user time-efficiency and usage likelihood.  | Simple UI with minimal distractions, meaningful icons, and keyword search. | Cluttered UI causes frustration and avoidance.                             |
| Intuitive Operation   | Users should require minimal instructions, speeding learning and improving convenience.   | Familiar icons, predictable navigation, consistent affordances like color-coded buttons. | Poorly placed features lead to confusion and reduced convenience.         |
| Stimulation           | Motivated users engage more deeply and repeatedly.                   | Add playful or motivational features such as badges, progress points, or rewards.  | Lack of stimulation leads to unremarkable product perception and churn.   |
