### Task 3.1 (Most important core UX factors)

Below are the user experience factors our team considers most important for Studyconnect, listed in descending order, with concise reasoning for each.

1) Bequemlichkeit (Convenience)

    Convenience reduces friction and directly affects adoption and retention. Studyconnect should minimise the number of steps and cognitive effort required to complete common tasks (task creation, status updates, quick lookups). Defaults, sensible presets and inline workflows help users accomplish goals quickly and with minimal interruption.

2) Vollständigkeit (Completeness)

    Functional completeness ensures the product addresses core user needs end-to-end. Partial implementations (e.g., chat without task management) risk limiting usage to niche scenarios and undermine the product's value proposition. Prioritise a coherent feature set that supports primary workflows.

3) Aktualität (Timeliness)

    Timely information is essential for collaboration and coordination. Notifications, message delivery and task status changes must be reflected within acceptable latency bounds so users can rely on the system for up-to-date decision making and planning.

4) Effizienz (Efficiency)

    Efficiency is about minimizing elapsed time and effort per interaction. The UI and backend should deliver snappy responses, support bulk or shortcut actions, and avoid blocking flows. Perceived performance (optimistic updates, progressive rendering) significantly improves user satisfaction.

5) Vertrauen (Trust)

    Trust is fundamental for user retention and data-sensitive features. Implement robust authentication, clear privacy practices and appropriate data protection (encryption, secure transport). Communicate security measures transparently to build user confidence.

6) Übersichtlichkeit (Clarity / Overview)

    A clear information architecture and visual hierarchy enable users to locate features and items quickly. Use prioritisation, consistent affordances and unobtrusive visual cues to reduce clutter and make key actions discoverable at a glance.

7) Leichtigkeit (Ease of use)

    Ease of use focuses on reducing micro-friction in common tasks. Small conveniences—autocompletion, sensible defaults, inline editing—reduce task completion time and lower the entry barrier for new users.

8) Verbundenheit (Loyalty)

    Loyalty emerges from sustained value and differentiation. Offer features or experiences that create community and recurring use (shared projects, meaningful notifications, integrations) so that switching costs increase and users remain engaged.

9) Intuitive Bedienung (Intuitive operation)

    Intuitive interactions follow established conventions and reduce learning time. Consistent iconography, predictable navigation and standard affordances (e.g., colour conventions for confirm/cancel) let users operate the product with minimal guidance.

### Task 3.2 (List the corresponding UX factor for each sentence)

| Emotional Reactions | UX Factor |
|---------------------|-----------|
|“That is exactly what I needed.”|Vollständigkeit|
|“It makes life easier.”|Bequemlichkeit|
|“I'm in control.” or “I am the boss.”|Anpassbarkeit|
|“We know each other.”|Verbundenheit|
|“Not being alone.”|Soziales|
|“Wow.”|Neuartigkeit / Originalität|
|“Something went wrong.”|Steuerbarkeit|
|“I've never seen anything like this before.”|Neuartigkeit|

### Task 3.3

| UX Factor | Why is the factor important? | Designs or features to support this factor | What if the factor is ignored? |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Bequemlichkeit (Convenience) | Making common tasks in the Studyconnect app fast and effortless encourages regular use and reduces the mental overhead needed to plan, start, or update tasks. | Fast and easy task creation and handling. It should be possible to create a task with just a title and an optional deadline that can be changed later. A task status should be changeable with a single tap without opening details. Provide presets for deadlines (e.g., one week, two weeks, one month). | If adding or updating tasks feels slow and tedious, students will avoid the app. They may not recommend it to peers or may revert to existing options, effectively abandoning the app. |
| Effizienz (Efficiency) | Students often have limited, fragmented study time. Efficient workflows let them plan or update tasks in short breaks. Frequent checks and updates are common. Slow or overloaded interfaces make interactions tedious. | Fast, responsive UI and optimistic updates. Show success immediately and synchronize the app in the background to make it feel instant. Implement recurring task templates (e.g., clone an existing task). | An inefficient app leads to user frustration; laggy interactions and long, unclear processes create negative perceptions of the app. |
| Übersichtlichkeit (Clarity / Overview) | Being able to find and navigate the application quickly makes users more time-efficient and increases likelihood of continued use. | A simple user interface with minimal distractions gives users a clear overview of features. Use contrast, meaningful icons, and keywords to help users find what they need quickly. | A cluttered or overloaded application increases frustration and harms the product image; users may avoid engaging with it. |
| Intuitive Bedienung (Intuitive operation) | Users should not need extra instructions to use the application. This supports efficiency and convenience. | The application design should use familiar icons and menu patterns and place features where users expect them based on common design guidelines and conventions. | If users can't find features where they expect them, convenience is reduced and they may seek better alternatives. |
| Stimulation | When stimulated, users are more likely to engage with the product. | Add playful or motivational features that provide incentives beyond the main objective. | Without stimulating elements, the product may feel similar to many others on the market and fail to stand out; users might prefer competitors. |
