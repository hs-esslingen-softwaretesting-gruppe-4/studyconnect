### Task 3.1 (Most important core UX factors)

1) Bequemlichkeit (Convenience)

    The most important factor is convenience. If a product is inconvenient it will not be used if there are ways around it. This means for Studyconnect, that common messenger apps might be used instead.

2) Vollständigkeit (Completeness)

    Completeness is very important. If a product is not complete, users may not benefit from or be able to use the product. If in Studyconnect key functions like a chat are implemented but everything else is missing users may use it as a messenger but it does not fulfill its purpose of making studying in groups easier than with any other messenger.

3) Aktualität

    If Studyconnect does not show current content like messages or task updates within a, as acceptable, specified time delay users will use other products that allow them to communicate within it.

4) Effizienz (Efficiency)

    The User Experience is dependent on the efficiency of the product. While inefficient products also do the job. Studyconnect should not need a several seconds to process and display its content or else users may find using it a hassle and search for better products on the market.

5) Vertrauen (Trust)

    Especially in digital products trust is important to gain long-term users. If users deem Studyconnect to be untrustful, may that be because of a missing login or data encryption, they will look for other alternatives that may protect their personal data better.


6) Übersichtlichkeit (Overview)

    Reducing the visual complexity of an application is important for a smooth handling of tasks. If the overview would be miserable users might not or need a lot of time to find specific features. In Studyconnect, if finding the tasks you are working on requires navigating through several pages, it would lead to distress and a bad image of the product.

7) Leichtigkeit (Ease of use)

    Similar to overview, ease of use is important while handling the product. While overview is mainly about complexity, ease of use is about making a step in the process easier like auto fill functions do in search bars, especially when the search phrase is long.

8) Verbundenheit (Loyalty)

    The loyalty aspect is more dependent on the product in its importance, because Studyconnect has similar competitors the key aspect of differentiation has to be significant for creating loyalty to it.
    When there is an original or new product loyalty is reached more easily because the user might has to leave his comfort zone to find other solutions to his problems.

9) Intuitive Bedienung (intuitive handling)

    While certainly not the most important, intuitive handling is a rising factor of experience which gained importance with the standardization of interaction fields. For example green buttons are generally associated with truth or acceptance while red buttons are generally associated with invalidity and rejection.

### Task 3.3

| UX Factor | Why is the factor important? | Designs or features to support this factor | What if factor is ignored? |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Bequemlichkeit (Convenience) | Making common tasks in the Studyconnect app fast and effortless makes the user use the app more regularly. It also reduces the mental overhead needed to plan, start or update tasks. | Key features of implementing this factor are foremost a fast and easy task creation and handling. It should be possible to create a task with just a title, with an optional deadline which can be changed later. A task status should be able to get changed with a single tap without opening details. Presets for deadlines, e.g. in one week, 2 weeks, one month etc. | If adding or updating tasks feels slow and tedious, students will avoid the app. This could cause students to not recommend the app to peers, or even revert to other, already existing options, effectively abandoning the app. |
| Effizienz (Efficiency) | Students often have limited, fragmented study time. Efficient workflows let them plan or update tasks in short breaks. Also, students will frequently check/update existing tasks. Slow or overloaded interfaces make the interactions tedious. | Fast, responsive UI and optimistic updates. Show success immedmediately, synchronise the app in the background. This makes the app feel instant. Implement reocurring tasks templates, e.g clone an existing task to a new one. | A non-efficient app could lead to increased user frustration, as laggy interactions and long, unclear processes cause frustration, leading to negative perceptions of the app. |
| Übersichtlichkeit (Overall) | By finding and navigating the application  faster the user is more time efficient and will likely use it more often. | A simple User Interface with minimal distraction will allow the User to have a good overview of the features. Contrast colors and fitting Icons or Keywords will allow the user to quckly find what he needs. | A messy or overfilled application could lead to increased frustration and a bad image. The user might not want to engage with the application. |
| Intuitive Bedienung (Intuitie Operation) | The user should not need extra instructions to use the application. Aiding in upholding Efficiency and Convenience. | The application desing should concentrate on fitting, common icons and menus designs. It should use common locations of features which can be aquired by design guidlines and common practises. | When the user can't find features where he thinks they should be the convenience gets lowered and the user might look if there are better alternaties on the market. |
| Stimulation | When stimulated the user wants to engage more with the product. | Some playfull features for the users to gain motivation besides the main objective will stimulate them. | Without the stimulating part the product will be like most other products on the market. It won't stand out. And users might find the competition more attractive. |
