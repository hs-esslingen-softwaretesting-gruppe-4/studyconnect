# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.

# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow is triggered on pushes to any branch except main, but only when files in the backend/ directory are changed.
